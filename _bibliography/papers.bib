  journal={IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics},
  abstract={Ball-screw-driven stages are widely used in industry for long-range and high-precision fabrication. One of the main difficulties in 
  dealing with high-precision motion control is the nonlinear friction, which originates at elastic deformation of the mechanical components. 
  In this paper, first, a novel mechanical model of a ball-screw-driven stage is proposed to analyze the elastic deformation dynamics under various 
  motion conditions. It is achieved that the mechanical deformation characteristic of fast motions differs from the case of slow motions in the 
  zero-speed region, and therefore, performing friction compensation should take the motion conditions into account. Then, based on this observation, 
  a sinc-function-based friction compensation method for slow motions including both reverse motions and nonreverse motions and a Sigmoid-function-based 
  friction compensation method for fast reverse motions are proposed to improve the control performance. Thanks to the very few parameters, the 
  proposed methods can save much trouble in design and maintenance 
  and are particularly suitable for control purposes. Finally, the advantages of the proposed methods are evaluated by experiments.},

  journal={Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control},
  abstract={With the development of ocean energy exploration, reliable semi-submersible platforms with very small motion are expected to develop. 
  Especially, in a floating offshore wind turbine system, the maximum pitching amplitude is required to be less than a few degrees. To reduce 
  wave-induced pitch motion, a new type semi-submersible with suspensions and a design method of the suspension coefficients are presented. In 
  practical case, an add-on wave energy dissipation device mounted on a floating platform, such as the combined wave-wind energy converter system, 
  could be regarded as the suspension system. In this study, firstly, the conceptual semi-submersible is described. Then, the hydrodynamic loads to 
  the semi-submersible are linearized so that the whole system is expressed by a state-space model. The suspension design problem is transformed into 
  solving a constrained H ∞ optimization problem, which after all is the optimal controller design of a feedback system. Finally, numerical examples 
  are performed to verify the effectiveness of the design. 
  The results illustrate that the pitch motion of the semi-submersible can be remarkably reduced by the designed suspensions.},

  abstract={This paper addresses a fundamental study of a floating type shrouded wind turbine on the design, mathematical model and motion analysis. 
  Several novel concepts are introduced to the system for cost reduction: a revolute hinge is applied between the tower and the nacelle to maintain 
  the orientation of the nacelle even in a large tower inclination, a swashplate mechanism with cyclic control is employed for blade pitch regulation 
  to improve the system controllability, a novel mooring system with a slewing bearing is utilized to build the passive yawing system, and an advanced 
  spar-type floater is used to obtain high restoring performance with a short spar. Firstly, the design aspects of the main components of the system 
  are given. Then, the numerical model including the structural model, hydrodynamic/aerodynamic model, and the control system is presented. 
  The static and dynamic responses under both the operational situation and survival conditions are finally studied. The paper illustrates the 
  probability of the 
  shrouded wind turbine on floating offshore application, and can provide critical information for the optimization design in next stage.},

  journal={Ocean Engineering},
  abstract={Three-legged triangular tension leg platforms (TLPs), which are a kind of compliant-type floating structure, are drawing attention 
  from industrial society. To reduce the transportation cost, a multiple linked ship towing system that the platform and anchor are linked and 
  wet towed is studied. A unified seakeeping and maneuvering method which can take account of the hydrodynamic interaction between the bodies 
  and utilize the experimental results for tuning the damping coefficients is proposed to model the towing system. In the method, a low-pass filter 
  is applied to separate the slowly and fast motion components for the maneuvering and seakeeping calculations. The maneuvering and seakeeping 
  problems can thus be solved simultaneously with a same time scale. SimMechanics™, which provides multi-body simulation environment for mechanical 
  systems, is applied to implement the numerical model for studying the fully coupled six degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) motion of the towing system. 
  Besides, experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the system and the effectiveness of the numerical model. A circular motion 
  in irregular waves is studied at the end and the issues of the system are discussed accordingly.},

  abstract={In this paper, a floating overhead power transmission system (FOPTS), which has the potentiality to lower the electricity transmission cost 
  for offshore renewable energy, is studied. In the design, a sheave mechanism is applied to mount one end of conductor on its supportive tower so that 
  the coupling effects between the conductor and its supportive towers are reduced. Then, a mathematical optimization approach, which can take account 
  of the placement of system's natural frequencies to avoid first-order wave excitation, is presented to design the properties of the floating 
  foundation and conductor. In the model-ing, the flexibility of the conductor is handled and both the first-and second-order wave loads are 
  considered. The aero-hydro-elastic dynamics of the system would be analyzed by the numerical model. Finally, a moderate FOPTS in a harsh ocean 
  environment with wind speed of 70 m/s and significant wave height of 14 m is studied with emphasis on the wind-wave misalignment. The feasibility 
  and issues of the system are discussed based on fully coupled time-domain simulation.},

  abstract={Integration of wave energy converters and floating wind turbine can potentially reduce the levelized cost of energy. 
  The coupling effects between the wave energy converters and the foundation, however, could amplify the foundation motion so that 
  both the efficiency and the fatigue life of wind turbine would be degraded. In this study, wave energy converters are designed as a
   controlled suspension system for a novel hybrid wind-wave energy system, and an optimal semi-active control method having 
   predictive ability is proposed for reducing the foundation motion. In the controller design, the physical constraints and 
   the passivity of the wave energy converters are also taken into consideration. A full numerical model taking account of 
   aero-hydro-servo-mooring coupled dynamics is proposed for a comprehensive analysis of the controller under various environmental conditions. 
   Numerical results show that the foundation motion can be reduced by 16% even in very rough sea states with the help of the controller.},
