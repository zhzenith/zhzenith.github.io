  abstract={This paper presents a new approach to reconstruct the plant output of linear time-invariant
systems in the case where the available output measurement is quantized. By fitting the quantized
measurement data with polynomials in a moving horizon manner, a smooth approximation of plant
output is obtained via solving a convex optimization problem. Applying the signal to an observer, the
plant output is reconstructed by taking account of the plant dynamics. It is guaranteed that the error
between the true and the reconstructed output is bounded. Experimental validation is given by using
a DC motor positioning system. It turns out that the proposed approach achieves small reconstruction
error and accurate tracking control. In addition, the approach yields a smooth reconstruction signal so
that the plant input is well behaved (or smooth) even if PID controller is employed for the plant subject
to quantized output measurement.},

  abstract={High-precision current control is demanded for many mechatronic systems to improve the static and dynamic performances. However, 
  current measurement error inherent in the measurement system degrade the control accuracy, since the motor currents are not guaranteed to 
  follow the desired references. In this paper, quantization error caused by analog-to-digital converters is studied. The dithering techniques 
  combined with Kalman filter are proposed to suppress the quantization effects. First, two dithered systems, including the subtractively dithered 
  and nonsubtractively dithered systems, are designed to whiten the quantization error. In the design of nonsubtractively dithered system, the 
  probability characteristic of the metering noise is utilized to minimize the measurement noise level. Then, Kalman filter is designed to estimate 
  the real current signals from the dithered current measurements. Since the variance of the total measurement error is theoretically calculable 
  according to the proposed dithering techniques, Kalman gain can be determined analytically. Finally, 
  simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches using a high-precision positioning system.},

  journal={IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics},
  abstract={Ball-screw-driven stages are widely used in industry for long-range and high-precision fabrication. One of the main difficulties in 
  dealing with high-precision motion control is the nonlinear friction, which originates at elastic deformation of the mechanical components. 
  In this paper, first, a novel mechanical model of a ball-screw-driven stage is proposed to analyze the elastic deformation dynamics under various 
  motion conditions. It is achieved that the mechanical deformation characteristic of fast motions differs from the case of slow motions in the 
  zero-speed region, and therefore, performing friction compensation should take the motion conditions into account. Then, based on this observation, 
  a sinc-function-based friction compensation method for slow motions including both reverse motions and nonreverse motions and a Sigmoid-function-based 
  friction compensation method for fast reverse motions are proposed to improve the control performance. Thanks to the very few parameters, the 
  proposed methods can save much trouble in design and maintenance 
  and are particularly suitable for control purposes. Finally, the advantages of the proposed methods are evaluated by experiments.},

  journal={Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control},
  abstract={With the development of ocean energy exploration, reliable semi-submersible platforms with very small motion are expected to develop. 
  Especially, in a floating offshore wind turbine system, the maximum pitching amplitude is required to be less than a few degrees. To reduce 
  wave-induced pitch motion, a new type semi-submersible with suspensions and a design method of the suspension coefficients are presented. In 
  practical case, an add-on wave energy dissipation device mounted on a floating platform, such as the combined wave-wind energy converter system, 
  could be regarded as the suspension system. In this study, firstly, the conceptual semi-submersible is described. Then, the hydrodynamic loads to 
  the semi-submersible are linearized so that the whole system is expressed by a state-space model. The suspension design problem is transformed into 
  solving a constrained H ∞ optimization problem, which after all is the optimal controller design of a feedback system. Finally, numerical examples 
  are performed to verify the effectiveness of the design. 
  The results illustrate that the pitch motion of the semi-submersible can be remarkably reduced by the designed suspensions.},

  to improve the system controllability, a novel mooring system with a slewing bearing is utilized to build the passive yawing system, and an advanced 
  spar-type floater is used to obtain high restoring performance with a short spar. Firstly, the design aspects of the main components of the system 
  are given. Then, the numerical model including the structural model, hydrodynamic/aerodynamic model, and the control system is presented. 
  The static and dynamic responses under both the operational situation and survival conditions are finally studied. The paper illustrates the

  wet towed is studied. A unified seakeeping and maneuvering method which can take account of the hydrodynamic interaction between the bodies 
  and utilize the experimental results for tuning the damping coefficients is proposed to model the towing system. In the method, a low-pass filter 
  is applied to separate the slowly and fast motion components for the maneuvering and seakeeping calculations. The maneuvering and seakeeping 
  problems can thus be solved simultaneously with a same time scale. SimMechanics™, which provides multi-body simulation environment for mechanical 
  systems, is applied to implement the numerical model for studying the fully coupled six degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) motion of the towing system. 
  Besides, experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the system and the effectiveness of the numerical model. A circular motion 
  in irregular waves is studied at the end and the issues of the system are discussed accordingly.},

  abstract={Integration of wave energy converters and floating wind turbine can potentially reduce the levelized cost of energy. 
  The coupling effects between the wave energy converters and the foundation, however, could amplify the foundation motion so that 
  both the efficiency and the fatigue life of wind turbine would be degraded. In this study, wave energy converters are designed as a
   controlled suspension system for a novel hybrid wind-wave energy system, and an optimal semi-active control method having 
   predictive ability is proposed for reducing the foundation motion. In the controller design, the physical constraints and 
   the passivity of the wave energy converters are also taken into consideration. A full numerical model taking account of 
   aero-hydro-servo-mooring coupled dynamics is proposed for a comprehensive analysis of the controller under various environmental conditions. 
   Numerical results show that the foundation motion can be reduced by 16% even in very rough sea states with the help of the controller.},
