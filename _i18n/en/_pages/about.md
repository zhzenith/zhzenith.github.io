I'm an associate professor for offshore renewable energy at Research Institute for Applied Mechanics(RIAM), Kyushu University. My research of interests are motion control, mathematical optermization, floating offshore wind/wave energy conversion systems, and multi-body dynamics. 

My PhD was at the department of electrical engineering and information systems, The University of Tokyo where I worked on high-precision motion control. Prior to this I studied control theory and convex optimization at Kyoto University and physics at Shanghai University of Electric Power.  

I love running, playing badminton and basketball. I also prefer to DIY at home and programming.
